# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
amount = 3
food = "Tacos"
# z = x * y

# Non-numbers
puts "#{food} on today's menu: #{amount}"

# True, False
x = 3
y = 5


# Nothing

# Variables

# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation
